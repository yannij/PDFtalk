PDF Lab Colour Spaces as defined in PDF 32000_2008.pdf, section 8.6.5.4, pp. 148.

A Lab colour space is a CIE-based ABC colour space with two transformation stages. 
In this type of space, A, B, and C represent the L*, a*, and b* components of a CIE 1976 L*a*b* space. 
The range of the first (L*) component shall be 0 to 100; 
the ranges of the second and third (a* and b*) components shall be defined by the Range entry in the colour space dictionary.
