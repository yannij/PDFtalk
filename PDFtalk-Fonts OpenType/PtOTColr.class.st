COLR - Color Table

The COLR table adds support for multi-colored glyphs in a manner that is compatible with existing text engines and easy to support with current OFF font files.

The COLR table defines a list of base glyphs â€” which are regular glyphs, typically associated with a cmap entry. Each base glyph is associated by the COLR table to a list of glyphs, each corresponding to layers that can be combined, creating a colored representation of the base glyph. The layered glyphs are explicitly defined in bottom-up z-order and each of their advance widths must match those of the base glyph. If the font has vertical metrics, the associated layer glyphs must also have the same advance height and vertical Y origin as the base glyph.

The COLR table works together with the CPAL table which holds the color palettes used by the color layers.

Fonts using 'COLR' and 'CPAL' tables must implement GlyphID 1 as the .null glyph. If the COLR table is present in a font but no CPAL table exists, then the COLR table will not be supported for this font.
