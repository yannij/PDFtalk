The DSIG table contains the digital signature of the OpenTypeâ„¢ font. Signature formats are widely documented and rely on a key pair architecture. Software developers, or publishers posting material on the Internet, create signatures using a private key. Operating systems or applications authenticate the signature using a public key.

The W3C and major software and operating system developers have specified security standards that describe signature formats, specify secure collections of web objects, and recommend authentication architecture. OpenType fonts with signatures will support these standards.

OpenType fonts offer many security features:

    * Operating systems and browsing applications can identify the source and integrity of font files before using them,
    * Font developers can specify embedding restrictions in OpenType fonts, and these restrictions cannot be altered in a font signed by the developer.

The enforcement of signatures is an administrative policy, enabled by the operating system. Windows will soon require installed software components, including fonts, to be signed. Internet browsers will also give users and administrators the ability to screen out unsigned objects obtained on-line, including web pages, fonts, graphics, and software components.

Anyone can obtain identity certificates and encryption keys from a certifying agency, such as Verisign or GTE's Cybertrust, free or at a very low cost.
