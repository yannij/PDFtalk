The vertical header table (tag name: 'vhea') contains information needed for vertical fonts. The glyphs of vertical fonts are written either top to bottom or bottom to top. This table contains information that is general to the font as a whole. Information that pertains to specific glyphs is given in the vertical metrics table (tag name: 'vmtx') described separately. The formats of these tables are similar to those for horizontal metrics (hhea and hmtx).

Data in the vertical header table must be consistent with data that appears in the vertical metrics table. The advance height and top sidebearing values in the vertical metrics table must correspond with the maximum advance height and minimum bottom sidebearing values in the vertical header table.

See the section â€œOpenType CJK Font Guidelinesâ€œ for more information about constructing CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) fonts.

The difference between version 1.0 and version 1.1 is the name and definition of:

    * ascender becomes vertTypoAscender
    * descender becomes vertTypoDescender
    * lineGap becomes vertTypoLineGap
